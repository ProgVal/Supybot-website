This is not (yet?) the official Supybot website. The
<a href="http://supybot.com">official website</a> went down several years ago,
and now redirects to the Sourceforge project.
This website aims to become the new official site, but is still under heavy
development.
</p>
<p>
This website is powered by the <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> scripting
language, the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> Web
framework, and is hosted on a <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>
server.
The engine that powers the paste system is a modified version of
<a href="https://github.com/bartTC/django-paste">Dpaste</a>.
</p>
<p>
The website itself is written by ProgVal, and its source code is available at
<a href="https://github.com/ProgVal/Supybot-website">GitHub</a> and is
licensed under a 3-clauses BSD-license.
